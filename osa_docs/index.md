# Project Overview

## Main Idea
The `repo_agent` project is a comprehensive tool designed to automate the generation and management of documentation for Python projects within a Git repository. It integrates various functionalities to ensure that the documentation remains up-to-date and accurately reflects the current state of the codebase. The project leverages Git to detect changes, manage file handling, and generate documentation summaries, while also providing a command-line interface (CLI) for easy interaction. Additionally, it supports multi-threaded task management and configuration settings to customize the documentation generation process.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of the `repo_agent` project is to streamline the documentation process for developers and maintainers of Python projects. By automating the detection of changes, generation of documentation, and management of file states, the tool aims to reduce the manual effort required to keep documentation in sync with the codebase. This ensures that the documentation is always current and useful, enhancing the overall maintainability and usability of the project.
