# RepoAgent
## Overview
RepoAgent is a tool designed for automated documentation generation and management within Git repositories. It analyzes repository structure, identifies code components, and leverages a chat engine to produce summaries and potentially update documentation based on changes detected in the codebase. 

## Purpose
The primary purpose of RepoAgent is to streamline the process of keeping software project documentation current and accurate by automatically summarizing code and managing documentation updates. This includes recursively traversing directories, identifying Python files, and generating summaries for each module within a repository.
