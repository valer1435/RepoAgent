# Repo Agent
## Overview

The `repo_agent` module provides a framework for analyzing and interacting with code repositories. It encompasses functionalities for detecting changes, managing project settings, orchestrating tasks, handling files, logging events, summarizing repository content, and providing a command-line interface for execution. The module utilizes classes like `ChangeDetector`, `ProjectManager`, and `Runner` to facilitate these operations, alongside utility functions for various supporting tasks.

## Purpose

This module serves as the core engine for repository analysis and automation. It enables users to:

*   Monitor repositories for modifications using the `ChangeDetector`.
*   Manage project-specific configurations through the `ProjectSettings` and `SettingsManager` classes.
*   Execute a series of tasks related to code processing and summarization via the `TaskManager` and `Task` classes.
*   Interact with files within the repository using the `FileHandler`.
*   Generate summaries of the repository structure and content utilizing the `module_summarization` functions. 
*   Configure logging behavior for debugging and monitoring purposes through the `InterceptHandler` and related functions.
*   Run analysis tasks from the command line via the provided `cli` function.
