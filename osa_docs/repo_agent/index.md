# Repo Agent Module
## Overview
The `Repo Agent` module is a comprehensive tool designed to automate the generation and management of documentation for Python projects within a Git repository. It integrates various functionalities to ensure that the documentation remains up-to-date and accurately reflects the current state of the codebase. The module includes classes and functions for detecting changes in Python files, generating and summarizing documentation, managing file handling, and organizing project structure. Additionally, it provides a command-line interface (CLI) for easy interaction and supports multi-threaded task management to handle complex documentation tasks efficiently.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of the `Repo Agent` module is to streamline the documentation process for developers and maintainers of Python projects. By automating the detection of changes, generation of documentation, and management of file states, the module aims to reduce the manual effort required to keep documentation in sync with the codebase. This ensures that the documentation is always current and useful, enhancing the overall maintainability and usability of the project. The module is designed to be flexible and configurable, allowing users to customize the documentation generation process according to their specific needs.
