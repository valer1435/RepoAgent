# Utils Module
## Overview
The `Utils` module is a collection of utility functions and classes designed to support the core functionalities of the `repo_agent` project. These utilities are essential for tasks such as updating and removing docstrings, checking files against `.gitignore` patterns, and managing temporary files in the repository. The module ensures that the documentation generation process is efficient and that the codebase remains clean and well-maintained.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of the `Utils` module is to provide a set of reusable tools that facilitate the automation of documentation and file management tasks within the `repo_agent` project. Specifically, it helps in:

- **Docstring Management**: Updating and removing docstrings from the code to ensure consistency and accuracy in the documentation.
- **Gitignore Handling**: Checking files and folders against `.gitignore` patterns to determine which should be ignored, ensuring that only relevant files are processed.
- **File State Management**: Creating, deleting, and recovering temporary files to maintain the integrity of the repository during the documentation generation process.

By providing these utilities, the `Utils` module enhances the overall functionality and reliability of the `repo_agent` project, making it easier for developers to manage and generate documentation for their Python projects.
