# Utils Module
## Overview
The `Utils` module is a collection of utility functions and classes designed to support the core functionalities of the `repo_agent` project. These utilities are essential for tasks such as updating and managing docstrings, checking files against `.gitignore` patterns, and handling temporary files in the repository. The module ensures that the documentation generation process is efficient and accurate, while also maintaining the integrity of the codebase.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of the `Utils` module is to provide a set of reusable tools that facilitate the automation of documentation management and file handling within a Git repository. Specifically, the module:

- **Updates and manages docstrings**: Functions are provided to update and remove docstrings from the code, ensuring that the documentation remains consistent and up-to-date.
- **Checks files against `.gitignore` patterns**: A utility class is included to determine which files and folders should be ignored based on the project's `.gitignore` file, helping to exclude unnecessary files from the documentation process.
- **Handles temporary files**: Functions are available to create, delete, and manage temporary files, ensuring that the repository's state is maintained and that modified files are recovered correctly.

By providing these utilities, the `Utils` module enhances the overall functionality and reliability of the `repo_agent` project, making it easier for developers to manage and generate documentation for their Python projects.
