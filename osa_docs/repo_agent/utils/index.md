# Utils
## Overview
The `utils` module provides a collection of utility functions and classes to support core functionalities within the RepoAgent tool. It focuses on file system interactions, `.gitignore` handling, and temporary file management crucial for documentation generation and updates.

## Purpose
This module serves to facilitate automated documentation processes by providing tools for: checking files against `.gitignore` rules; creating and deleting temporary files needed during analysis and documentation generation; and updating docstrings within the codebase. It supports RepoAgent's ability to analyze code changes, manage project files, and maintain synchronized documentation. Specifically, it enables identifying relevant files for documentation updates while respecting exclusion patterns defined in `.gitignore`, managing fake files created during the process, and modifying existing docstrings.
