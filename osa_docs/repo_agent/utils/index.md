# Utils
## Overview
The `utils` module provides a collection of utility functions and classes to support repository analysis and documentation management tasks. It includes functionalities for updating docstrings, checking `.gitignore` configurations, and managing temporary files used during processing.

## Purpose
This module serves as a toolkit for internal operations within the RepoAgent system. Specifically, it facilitates: 

- Modifying or removing existing docstrings in code files.
- Verifying the presence of necessary files based on `.gitignore` rules.
- Creating and deleting temporary files required for analysis and documentation generation processes. 

These utilities contribute to automated documentation workflows by enabling manipulation of code documentation and managing supporting files effectively.
