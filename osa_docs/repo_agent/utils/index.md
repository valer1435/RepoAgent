# Utils
## Overview
The `utils` module provides a collection of utility functions and classes to support repository analysis tasks. It includes functionalities for manipulating docstrings, checking `.gitignore` configurations, and managing temporary files used during processing.

## Purpose
This module serves as a toolkit for common operations required within the broader code analysis workflow. Specifically, it offers tools for: 

*   Updating or removing docstrings from code files.
*   Verifying adherence to `.gitignore` rules.
*   Creating and deleting temporary files needed for testing or intermediate processing steps. 

These utilities contribute to a more robust and flexible repository analysis process by providing reusable components for file manipulation and project configuration management.
