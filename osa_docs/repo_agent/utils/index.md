# Utils
## Overview
The `utils` module provides a collection of utility functions and classes to support repository analysis and manipulation, specifically focused on documentation workflows. It includes functionalities for updating docstrings, checking `.gitignore` configurations, and managing temporary files used during processing.

## Purpose
This module serves as a toolkit for internal operations within RepoAgent. It facilitates the automated documentation generation process by providing tools to modify code documentation directly (docstring updates), ensuring correct file handling based on repository exclusion rules (`.gitignore`), and creating/deleting temporary files needed for analysis or documentation building. This contributes to maintaining accurate and up-to-date project documentation.
