# Utils Module
## Overview
The `Utils` module is a collection of utility functions and classes designed to support the core functionalities of the `repo_agent` project. These utilities are essential for tasks such as updating and removing docstrings, checking files against `.gitignore` patterns, and managing temporary files in the repository. The module ensures that the documentation generation process is efficient and accurate by providing tools to handle various aspects of code and file management.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of the `Utils` module is to provide a set of reusable and reliable functions and classes that facilitate the automation of documentation generation and management. Specifically, it helps in:

- **Docstring Management**: Updating and removing docstrings from code to ensure consistency and accuracy in the documentation.
- **Gitignore Handling**: Checking files and folders against `.gitignore` patterns to determine which should be ignored, ensuring that only relevant files are processed.
- **File State Management**: Creating, deleting, and recovering temporary files to maintain the integrity of the repository during the documentation generation process.

By providing these utilities, the `Utils` module enhances the overall functionality and reliability of the `repo_agent` project, making it easier for developers to keep their documentation up-to-date and synchronized with the codebase.
