# Utils Module
## Overview
The `Utils` module is a collection of utility functions and classes designed to support the core functionalities of the `repo_agent` project. It includes tools for updating and removing docstrings, checking files against `.gitignore` patterns, and managing temporary files and file states. These utilities are essential for ensuring that the documentation generation process is efficient, accurate, and maintains the integrity of the codebase.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of the `Utils` module is to provide a set of reusable and reliable tools that facilitate the automation of documentation generation and management. Specifically, it helps in:

- **Docstring Management**: Updating and removing docstrings from code to ensure consistency and accuracy in the documentation.
- **Gitignore Compliance**: Checking files and folders against `.gitignore` patterns to exclude irrelevant files from the documentation process.
- **File State Management**: Creating, deleting, and recovering temporary files to maintain the integrity of the repository during the documentation generation process.

By integrating these utilities, the `Utils` module enhances the overall functionality and reliability of the `repo_agent` project, making it easier for developers to manage and maintain high-quality documentation.
