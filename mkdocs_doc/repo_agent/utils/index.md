# Utils Module
## Overview
The `Utils` module is a collection of utility classes and functions designed to support the automation of documentation generation and management for a Git repository. It includes tools for updating and removing docstrings, checking files against `.gitignore` patterns, and managing temporary files and modifications. These utilities are essential for ensuring that the documentation process is efficient, accurate, and seamlessly integrated with the Git environment.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of the `Utils` module is to provide a set of reusable and robust tools that facilitate the automated documentation process. Specifically, it aims to:

- **Update and Remove Docstrings**: Automate the modification of docstrings in the codebase to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- **Gitignore Pattern Checking**: Efficiently determine which files and folders should be ignored based on the project's `.gitignore` file, preventing unnecessary processing.
- **Temporary File Management**: Handle the creation, deletion, and recovery of temporary files to maintain the integrity of the repository during documentation generation and other automated tasks.

By providing these functionalities, the `Utils` module enhances the overall efficiency and reliability of the documentation tool, making it easier to manage and maintain large and complex repositories.
