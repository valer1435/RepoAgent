# Repo Agent Module
## Overview
The `Repo Agent` module is a comprehensive tool designed to automate the generation and management of documentation for a Git repository. It integrates various functionalities to detect changes in Python files, handle file operations, manage tasks, and configure settings. The module ensures that the documentation remains up-to-date and reflects the current state of the codebase, leveraging Git's capabilities to track changes and manage files efficiently.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of the `Repo Agent` module is to streamline the documentation process for software repositories. It aims to reduce the manual effort required to keep documentation up-to-date by:

- **Detecting Changes**: Automatically identifying changes in Python files within the repository.
- **Handling File Operations**: Reading, writing, and managing file content and structure.
- **Managing Tasks**: Organizing and executing tasks with dependencies in a multi-threaded environment.
- **Configuring Settings**: Providing a flexible and configurable setup for project and chat completion settings.

By automating these tasks, the `Repo Agent` module enhances productivity and ensures that documentation remains synchronized with the codebase, making it particularly useful for large and complex repositories.
