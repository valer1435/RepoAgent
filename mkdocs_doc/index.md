# Overview of the Project

## Main Idea
The project is a comprehensive tool designed to automate the generation and management of documentation for a Git repository. It integrates various functionalities to detect changes, handle file operations, manage tasks, and configure settings, all while ensuring efficient and accurate documentation updates. The tool is built to work seamlessly within a Git environment, leveraging Git's capabilities to track changes and manage files.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to streamline the documentation process for software repositories. It aims to reduce the manual effort required to keep documentation up-to-date by automatically detecting changes, generating necessary documentation, and managing the overall structure and configuration of the project. This tool is particularly useful for large repositories where maintaining consistent and accurate documentation can be challenging and time-consuming. By automating these tasks, the project enhances productivity and ensures that documentation remains synchronized with the codebase.
