# Repository Agent Documentation Generator

The Repository Agent is an LLM-Powered framework designed to generate comprehensive documentation for Python projects at the repository level. It automates the process of creating and updating documentation by analyzing code, identifying changes, and summarizing module contents.

## Key Features

- **Code Analysis**: Automatically detects and documents functions, classes, and other components within a project.
- **Change Detection**: Identifies modifications in the repository to update existing documentation accordingly.
- **Interactive Chat Session**: Allows users to interactively query and generate documentation for specific parts of the codebase.
- **Task Management**: Efficiently handles multiple tasks concurrently using a task manager system.

## Usage

The framework can be run via command-line interfaces or integrated into development workflows. It supports various operations such as generating new documentation, updating existing documents based on changes, cleaning up temporary files, and summarizing repository contents.

## Components Overview

- **Documentation Generation**: Utilizes LLMs to generate accurate and detailed documentation for code elements.
- **Change Detection**: Monitors the repository for modifications and updates documentation accordingly.
- **Task Handling**: Manages multiple tasks concurrently to optimize performance and resource utilization.
- **Configuration Management**: Allows customization of settings through a configuration system.

## Getting Started

To use the Repository Agent, clone the project repository and follow the instructions provided in the README file. Detailed setup guides and usage examples are available for both command-line interfaces and integrated development environments (IDEs).
