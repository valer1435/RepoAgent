# Repository Agent

## Overview
The Repository Agent is a framework designed to automate the generation and maintenance of comprehensive documentation for Python projects at the repository level. It leverages language models (LLMs) to analyze code, detect changes, and generate detailed documentation.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of the Repository Agent module is to streamline the process of creating and updating documentation within Python repositories. This module includes functionalities such as:

- **Code Analysis**: Automatically identifies functions, classes, and other components in a project.
- **Change Detection**: Monitors repository changes to update existing documentation accordingly.
- **Documentation Generation**: Utilizes LLMs to generate accurate and detailed documentation for code elements.
- **Task Management**: Manages multiple tasks concurrently to optimize performance.

This module aims to enhance developer productivity by automating the documentation process, ensuring that Python projects maintain up-to-date and comprehensive documentation.
