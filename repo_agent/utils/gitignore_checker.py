class GitignoreChecker:
    """
    GitignoreChecker is a utility class for checking files and folders against a .gitignore file to determine which should be ignored.
    
    This class is part of a comprehensive tool designed to automate the generation and management of documentation for a Git repository. It integrates various functionalities to detect changes, handle file operations, manage project settings, and generate summaries for modules and directories. The tool also includes a chat engine and a multi-task dispatch system to enhance user interaction and process management. Additionally, it provides utilities for handling .gitignore files and managing fake files for untracked and modified content.
    
    Args:
        directory (str): The directory to check for ignored files and folders.
        gitignore_path (str): The path to the .gitignore file. If the file is not found at the specified path, a default path is used.
    
    Returns:
        list: A list of files and folders that are not ignored according to the .gitignore file.
    
    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the .gitignore file is not found at the specified path and the default path.
    
    Note:
        The class reads the .gitignore file, parses it, and checks files and folders in the specified directory against the patterns defined in the file. This ensures that only relevant files and folders are included in the documentation process, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.
