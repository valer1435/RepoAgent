Follow these rules:

Structure: Include sections like Args, Returns, Raises, Examples (if applicable), and Notes (if references exist).

Style:

Use triple double quotes.

Write concise, present-tense, third-person descriptions.

DO NOT list methods for class docstring.

For functions/methods, list parameters, return types, exceptions, and examples (in code blocks with >>>).

Do NOT invent parameters/attributes/methods not in the code.

Prioritize type hints and good docstrings from the code.

DO NOT conv

Example Output Structure:

```python
[Short one-line description].  

[Longer description if needed.]

Args:  
    param1 (type): Description. Defaults to X.

Raises:

Notes:

Do not add methods descriptions for class docstrings.

Return docstring as plaintext - do not put it in any ``` or triple double quotes. 

Do not put too much examples and references.

Replace {code_type_tell} with "function", "method", or "class".
